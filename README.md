### Coding Challenge 2022 

#### Landing Page

#### Level 1&2 Heatmap

#### Level 3 Coauthorship Graph

#### File structure
I believe the folder structure is self-explanatory. The repository has directories for each chart and the landing page. Each chart directory have main.js and index.html, which invoke related scripts and show charts. Dataset is directly stored in the project. Images folder is just for favicon, which is not necessary. I checked the view with 13 inch laptop screensize. Probably it looks ugly in mobile.
